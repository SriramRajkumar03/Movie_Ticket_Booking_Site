        <span>Welcome to Kinofist Cinema</span><br /><br />
        It all started in 1974 when we acquired ‘The Royal Madras Complex’ and
        renamed it Kinofist Cinema. <br /><br />In 1999, our CEO had a vision -
        to completely transform the way people watch movies. So we set forth to
        build a new screen. With comfortable seats and digital technology,
        watching movies was an experience like never before. From then on, one
        after the other, the renovations began - first the space and technology,
        then the food and beverage and in parallel the entire customer
        experience. <br /><br />
        In 2005, the main screen at Kinofist Cinema went digital for the epic
        Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, followed by the rest of
        the screens over the next two years. Our entire F&B experience was given
        a makeover by French Chef Mickaël Arnaud, who curated a delectable menu
        across both our concessions and restaurants. The cinema also got a
        15,000 square feet gaming zone and an international patisserie.
        <br /><br />
        This was really the start of the Kinofist Experience, as you know it
        today. Kinofist went on to become one of the most loved brands in the
        city of Chennai and till today, continues to be close to the hearts of
        millions of its patrons. <br /><br />
        Since then, it has been an exciting journey filled with learnings.
